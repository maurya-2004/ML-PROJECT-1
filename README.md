## 📖 Overview

Access to clean drinking water is critical for health and well-being. This project helps identify unsafe water sources by predicting potability based on chemical parameters like pH, solids, chloramines, turbidity, etc.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Build a machine learning model to classify water as **potable** or **non-potable**.
- Analyze and understand the factors affecting water quality.
- Provide an interpretable solution to assist public health decisions.

## 📊 Dataset

- **Samples**: 3,279
- **Features**: pH, Hardness, Solids, Chloramines, Sulfate, Conductivity, Organic Carbon, Trihalomethanes, Turbidity, Potability
- **Target**: `Potability` (0 = Non-potable, 1 = Potable)

**Preprocessing:**
- Handled missing values via mean imputation.
- Engineered a new feature: `TDS_estimate = Solids + Chloramines`

---

## 🔍 Methodology

- **Data Preprocessing**: 
  - Handled missing values
  - Feature scaling using `StandardScaler`
  - Feature engineering (TDS_estimate)

- **Model Used**: Random Forest Classifier (RFC)
  - `n_estimators = 200`
  - `max_depth = 10`
  - `class_weight = 'balanced'`

- **Evaluation Metrics**:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision, Recall, F1-Score
  - Confusion Matrix

## 📈 Model Performance

| Metric     | Score |
|------------|-------|
| Accuracy   | ~65%  |
| Precision  | 0.62  |
| Recall     | 0.65  |
| F1-Score   | 0.63  |

### Confusion Matrix

|              | Predicted: Non-Potable | Predicted: Potable |
|--------------|-------------------------|---------------------|
| Actual: Non-Potable | 320 (TN)              | 180 (FP)            |
| Actual: Potable     | 150 (FN)              | 250 (TP)            |

## ⚠️ Challenges & Learnings

### Challenges
- Class imbalance (only 39% potable samples)
- Correlated features (e.g., TDS and Solids)
- Balancing accuracy vs interpretability

### Key Learnings
- Feature engineering improved model performance
- Class weight balancing handled imbalance well
- Confusion matrix gave better insights than accuracy alone
